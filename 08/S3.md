# Amazon S3

```What is Amazon S3? ```

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, 

- security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a 

- range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT 

- devices, and big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides management features so that you can optimize, organize, and configure access to your 

- data to meet your specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.


## Features of S3

- Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases. 

- For example, you can store mission-critical production data in S3 Standard for frequent access, 

- save costs by storing infrequently accessed data in S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA,and archive data at the lowest costs in S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

- You can store data with changing or unknown access patterns in S3 Intelligent-Tiering,
which optimizes storage costs by automatically moving your data between four access tiers when your access patterns change. 

- These four access tiers include two low-latency access tiers optimized for frequent and infrequent access, and two opt-in archive access tiers designed for asynchronous access for rarely accessed data.

## How Amazon S3 works

- Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. A bucket is a container for objects.

- To store your data in Amazon S3, you first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and AWS Region. Then, you upload your data to that bucket as objects in Amazon S3. Each object has a key (or key name), which is the unique identifier for the object within the bucket.

- S3 provides features that you can configure to support your specific use case. For example, you can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket, which allows you to restore objects that are accidentally deleted or overwritten.

- Buckets and the objects in them are private and can be accessed only if you explicitly grant access permissions. You can use bucket policies, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, access control lists (ACLs), and S3 Access Points to manage access.
