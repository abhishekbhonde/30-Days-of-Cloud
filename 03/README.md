# ROLES and POLICIES in IAM

Today i have explored roles and policies in iam service..

How to give permissions to user and how to assign different policies....


## ROLES

1] An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. 


2] An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. 


3] However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.


4] Also, a role does not have standard long-term credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. 


5] Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.



## POLICIES


1]  You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources.


2]  A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. 


3]  AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. 


4]  Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. 


5]  Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents.


6]  AWS supports six types of policies: 

identity-based policies, 

resource-based policies, 

permissions boundaries, 

Organizations SCPs, 

ACLs, 

session policies.
