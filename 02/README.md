## Today I have started to explore the first service of AWS..

The first service is ```IAM..```

The full form of ```IAM``` is ```Identity and Access Management....```

The some points which I learn about ```IAM ``` are ::

1]  AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. 

2]  With IAM, you can centrally manage permissions that control which AWS resources users can access. 

3]  You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

4]  When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. 

5]  This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. 

6]  I should strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks. 

7]  Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to perform the tasks that only the root user can perform. 

8]  For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see Tasks that require root user credentials in the [ AWS Account Management Reference Guide.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)


I have uploaded the post about it on twitter...
